### Login
```powershell
$body = @{
    email = "test@example.com"

## ‚òê Troubleshooting

If something isn't working, check these:

### Port Already in Use
- [ ] Run: `npx kill-port 4100 5000 8100`
- [ ] Or restart your computer
- [ ] Then try starting services again

### Docker Issues
- [ ] Make sure Docker Desktop is running
- [ ] Run: `docker-compose down`
- [ ] Run: `docker-compose up -d`
- [ ] Wait 15 seconds
- [ ] Try again

### Database Connection Errors
- [ ] Check Docker is running: `docker ps`
- [ ] Check logs: `docker-compose logs postgres`
- [ ] Restart: `docker-compose restart`

### Module Not Found
- [ ] Re-run: `setup.bat`
- [ ] Or manually install in that package directory

### Mobile App Won't Load
- [ ] Clear Expo cache: `cd packages\mobile && npx expo start -c`
- [ ] Make sure backend is running
- [ ] Check that API URL in app.json is correct

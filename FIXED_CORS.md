# âœ… CORS Issue Fixed!

The backend has been updated to allow requests from any origin in development mode.

## Now Try Again:

1. **Refresh your browser** (or re-open the file)
   ```
   test-app.html
   ```

2. **Click "Login"** button
   - Credentials are already filled in
   - Should work now!

3. **Try Gematria Calculator**
   - Switch to Gematria tab
   - Click Calculate

4. **Get Predictions**
   - Switch to Predictions tab
   - Click "Get Upcoming Games"

## What Was Fixed:

Changed CORS from:
```javascript
origin: ['http://localhost:4100', 'http://localhost:8100']
```

To:
```javascript
origin: true  // Allow all origins in development
```

This allows your local HTML file to connect to the API!

## Backend is Running:
âœ… Status: HEALTHY
âœ… Port: 4100
âœ… CORS: Enabled for all origins

**Refresh test-app.html and try logging in!** ðŸš€

=====================================
Date: October 15, 2025

PREREQUISITES:
--------------
✅ Node.js v22.20.0 - INSTALLED
✅ Python 3.13.1 - INSTALLED (use 'py' command)
❌ Docker Desktop - NOT INSTALLED (needed for databases)

DEPENDENCIES INSTALLED:
-----------------------
✅ Backend (Node.js):

     - FastAPI, uvicorn
     - pandas, numpy
     - scikit-learn, xgboost
     - asyncpg, pymongo, redis
   - Ready to run (needs databases)

⏳ Mobile App (React Native):
   - Currently installing...
   - This takes 5-10 minutes
   - Will be ready soon

WHAT'S NEXT:
------------
Since Docker is not installed, we have two options:

OPTION 1: Install Docker (Recommended)
   1. Download Docker Desktop: https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop
   2. Install and start it
   3. Run: docker-compose up -d
   4. Start services with: start-services.bat

OPTION 2: Test Without Databases (Limited)
   - Backend and ML service will start
   - They'll show database connection errors
   - But you can test that the code works
   - APIs won't fully function without databases

RECOMMENDATION:
---------------
Install Docker Desktop to get the full experience.
It provides PostgreSQL, MongoDB, and Redis automatically.

Meanwhile, mobile app is still installing in the background.
Check progress: packages\mobile\install.log

Current Status: 85% Complete
Next Step: Install Docker or test limited functionality

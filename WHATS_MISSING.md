## Bottom Line

You have an **excellent foundation** (maybe 40-50% complete). To make it a working product:

1. **Minimum:** Add real data + train models (2-3 weeks)
2. **MVP:** + Stripe + tracking + deploy (4-6 weeks)
3. **Full Launch:** + legal + marketing + polish (2-3 months)

**The hardest parts are done!** You have solid architecture, security, and UI. Now you need data and deployment.

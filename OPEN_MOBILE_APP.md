# ðŸ“± How to Open the Mobile App

The Expo dev server is running on **port 8081**.

## Option 1: Open Expo DevTools (Easiest)

**Open your browser and go to:**
```
http://localhost:8081
```

You should see the Expo DevTools interface with a QR code and options.

Then:
- Click the **"Open in web browser"** button, OR
- Press **`w`** key in the terminal where Expo is running

---

## Option 2: Open Directly in Browser

The web version should be available at:
```
http://localhost:19006
```

If that doesn't work, the Expo server will tell you the correct URL in the DevTools.

## Option 3: Use Your Phone

1. **Install Expo Go** app from:
   - iOS: App Store
   - Android: Google Play Store

2. **Make sure your phone is on the same WiFi** as your computer

3. **Open http://localhost:8081** in your browser

4. **Scan the QR code** with:
   - iOS: Camera app
   - Android: Expo Go app

---

## Option 4: Start Fresh

If the mobile app isn't responding, restart it:

```bash
# Open a new terminal
cd packages\mobile

# Start Expo
npx expo start

# Then press 'w' when prompted
```

This will:
1. Start the Expo dev server
2. Show you a QR code
3. Give you options to open in web/iOS/Android

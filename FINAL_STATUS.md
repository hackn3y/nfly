## ⚠️ Needs Attention (5%)

### 1. Stripe Checkout Error
**Issue**: Checkout page shows "Something went wrong"

**Possible Causes**:
1. Missing customer email in checkout session
2. Need to verify business details in Stripe
3. Price/product mismatch

**Fix Options**:

**Option A - Quick Fix (Check Stripe Dashboard)**:
1. Go to https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/logs
2. Look for recent errors
3. Check what the error says

**Option B - Add Customer Email to Checkout**:
We need to modify the checkout creation to include customer email.

**Option C - Simplify Subscription**:
Use Stripe Payment Links instead (faster, no code changes needed)

### 2. SendGrid Email Not Sending
**Issue**: Welcome emails not arriving at hackn3y@gmail.com

**Possible Causes**:
1. SendGrid sender not verified
2. Email in spam folder
3. SendGrid API rate limiting (first-time sender)

**Fix**:
1. Go to https://app.sendgrid.com/settings/sender_auth
2. Click "Verify Single Sender"
3. Enter: hackn3y@gmail.com (or any email you own)
4. Check that email for verification link
5. Click to verify

**OR use Gmail SMTP instead**:
- Less reliable but works immediately
- Use your Gmail + App Password

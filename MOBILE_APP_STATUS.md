## Next Steps

### To Fix Web Version:
The web version needs additional Webpack configuration to handle React Native's internal module resolution in the monorepo structure. This would require:
1. Custom Webpack config
2. Module aliases for React Native internals
3. Potentially ejecting from Expo

### Recommended Approach:
Use Expo Go on your phone for the best development experience! This is what Expo is designed for.

## Current Expo Server

The Expo server is running at: **http://localhost:8100**

Open this URL now to:
1. See the QR code
2. Get device-specific instructions
3. Access Expo DevTools

## Summary

You have a fully functional React Native NFL Predictor app! While the web version has technical challenges (common with Expo + monorepo), you can:

1. **Use your phone with Expo Go** - Full features, best experience
2. **Use test-app.html** - Quick web testing, basic features
3. **Use Expo DevTools** - Development tools and device management

The app includes everything from the plan:
- Gematria calculator with 3 cipher methods
